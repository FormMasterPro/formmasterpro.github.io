        <div class="faq-item">
          <p class="faq-question">What is an AI browser assistant?</p>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>An AI browser assistant is software that helps automate tasks in your web browser, such as filling out forms, navigating through websites, interacting with content, and assisting with decision making. These assistants typically use both visual information and structural data (HTML/DOM) to understand and interact with web pages.</p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p class="faq-question">Is FormMasterPro a complete AI browser assistant?</p>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Currently, FormMasterPro focuses specifically on form filling automation, which is one important capability of AI browser assistants. Our product excels at analyzing form structures and mapping your data to form fields. Additional browser assistant capabilities like automated navigation, quiz assistance, and decision support are on our development roadmap but are not yet available in the current version.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <p class="faq-question">Will FormMasterPro be able to navigate through multi-page forms in the future?</p>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes, enhanced navigation through multi-page forms and processes is on our development roadmap. Future versions of FormMasterPro will aim to intelligently click through page sequences and understand the flow of complex form submissions. However, our current version focuses on automating form filling on individual pages.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <p class="faq-question">How does FormMasterPro process visual and structural data?</p>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>FormMasterPro primarily analyzes the HTML/DOM structure of web pages to understand form fields and their relationships. This structural analysis allows it to accurately identify form elements and determine appropriate data mapping. Visual processing capabilities to enhance this understanding are being developed for future versions.</p>
